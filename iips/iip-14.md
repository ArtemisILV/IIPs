## Simple Summary
To streamline the Illuvinati Council's operations by modifying IIP-12 and more clearly defining the role of the Council. To that end, we propose the following modifications to IIP-12:

*“The Council will be expected to meet regularly and report on its deliberations.”*
Council will meet on an ad-hoc basis. Council will not report on its deliberations to facilitate free-flowing discussion and for competitive/privacy reasons. However, Council members are encouraged to communicate their rationale behind their voting decisions to the community in written and/or oral form. 

*“The Illuvium team will appoint a Community Manager to provide support and facilitate Council functions.”* 
No change.

*“The Illuvium team will implement a Council section on the official website dedicated to reporting Council activities and other governance matters.*” - 
On hold, not a priority right now.


## Abstract
The original intent of IIP-12 was to introduce more structure to the Council but, in practice, has become a burden on the Council and team given the reporting requirements. After deliberating as a Council and in discussion with the team, we believe that the modifications to IIP-12 remove unnecessary administrative burdens but preserve the original intent of the proposal which was to optimize the functioning of the Council and to empower the team in building the best Web3 game. To that end, we propose to make modifications to IIP-12 to prioritize the original responsibilities of the Council which [“include debating and voting on ICCPs and IIPs within a public forum on discord.”](https://docs.illuvium.io/whitepaper/dao/)

To that end, the Council has determined that instead of having regularly scheduled meetings, it will have free-flowing, ad-hoc meetings. In the spirit of transparency, the Council members are encouraged to communicate their voting decisions to the community in either written or verbal form. We also may hold ad-hoc community forums to gather feedback from the community, especially when ICCPs and IIPs are up for proposal.

## Rationale
The intent of IIP-12 was to bring more transparency to the Council. IIP-14 preserves that original intent and optimizes the ability of the Council to operate more efficiently, and in line with the requirements of the team. Members of the Council will strive to provide a rationale for their voting decisions to the community but the discussions that happen among Council and team members will not be disclosed for privacy/competitive reasons (we do not want these discussions to be leaked to our competitors). Instead, we may elect to have ad-hoc Discord forums with the community, especially when there are ICP and ICCPs to be decided on. Ultimately, our goal remains the same which is to continue to serve the community that elected us and act as a sounding board to the team when it comes to primarily non-product decisions. We believe that IIP-14 will optimize the Council and strengthen the position of Illuvium as the leading Web3 game.
