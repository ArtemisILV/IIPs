## Simple Summary


## Abstract 



## Overview


## Rationale

IIP 4 gives the prospective investors more confidence in the overall distribution of ILV, and the APY in the Illuvium protocol. The reduction in total tokens for locked token holders is expected to be far smaller than the increase in value of the token, and as such it makes strong financial sense to implement this IIP for all parties.
