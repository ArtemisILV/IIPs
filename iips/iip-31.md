## Simple Summary:
Illuvium will not hold an Illuvitars D1sk battle with Su Zhu.

## Overview:
While Zhu Su is a well known figure in the web3 community and does have a larger follower count than Illuvium, direct association with him risks the reputation that the DAO has worked to curate.

Illuvium has constantly sought an image of being different and doing things right. The original presented "battle" not only places an Illuvium co-founder in direct connection with a controversial figure, but does so with the perception of an invitation from the DAO, on a stage provided by the DAO.

To ensure first introductions to Illuvium are not establishing a direct connection between a new, exciting product and a controversial figure representing arguably the perception the DAO has fought to separate itself from, the originally presented "d1sk battle" shall be canceled.

During this tenuous time for web3, it is important to avoid the risk of "scam by association."
