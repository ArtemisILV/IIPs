## Simple Summary
You are a Valain reconnaissance drone, ejected off your ship before impact with a ruined alien planet.Your mission: build a secure base of operations on the planet, gathering as much intel as possible. You collect, mine, and process local resources to build generators, storage silos, research facilities, and other key structures and tools.

Energy scans and observations of strange phenomena hint that this is no ordinary planet. Exotic particles visibly spill from rifts in the very fabric of reality—and these may or may not be related to the deity-like beasts that seem to dilate in and out of existence, like apparitions that materialize into corporeal forms.

With only the equipment of a reconnaissance drone, it seems unlikely you will be able to capture these beasts.

But by studying them, and researching their fuel, you may be able to make use of them—and their considerable powers.
