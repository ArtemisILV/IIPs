## Simple Summary

We are ready to take the next step towards a fully Layer 2 experience for our products. We planned the first Illuvitars sale for a hybrid L1/L2 system, but we now believe we can run it entirely on IMX. Providing our customers with a largely gas-free experience has always been our top priority. It also allows us to run the sale in a way we otherwise couldn’t, and we have outlined the changes below.

## Abstract

The community has resurrected the old IIP-013 for the Illuvitars Sale and suggested changes. While it is difficult to change things so far in development, it gave us an idea of what the community was looking for. Some of the changes they would like to make are things we would have initially, we had always planned to run the sale on IMX. As such, now that we can do so, we want to reconfigure things where possible.
These are not massive changes, and the product will primarily be the same, but even changing pricing can significantly improve the product’s function.

## Overview

We wish to move away from the traditional PFP project template. Illuvitars is already much more, but we still structured the pricing with the idea that the average customer would own just a few at most. Because of gas fees, where each mint may be upwards of $50, we always knew we could innovate to improve the product. It makes no sense for the product to have a low entry price with high gas fees.
Running the sale on IMX allows us to alter the price so players can purchase packs of Illuvitars for a much lower fee. With three billion+ combinations, it doesn’t feel right that most of those combos will never exist. This proposal fixes these issues.

**Summary of Changes**

- A vastly lower entry price per Illuvitar with zero gas fees
- Purchase NFT packs called D1sks that players can open when they choose.
- NOTE: D1sks will form the delivery mechanism for other products in the future such as cosmetics.
- A free Tier 0 Illuvitar in every basic D1sk.
- A simplified 2 D1sk system (basic and Ultra)
- The Illuvitars Album: A collection game players try to fill to get rewards.

**sILV2 will still be usable after onboarding to IMX**

**Pricing**

There are two D1sks available. A Basic D1sk costs 0.015 ETH and contains 1 random Illuvitar and 3 random Accessories (plus a free Tier 0). The Ultra D1sk costs 0.075 ETH, swaps the Tier 0 for a higher tier, and includes at least one guaranteed rare.

**D1sks**

The player no longer purchases a crate with one random Illuvitar revealed on purchase. Instead, they buy a D1sk they can open whenever they choose. It contains the metadata to link it to a particular sale, allowing players to speculate on the value of unopened D1sks from a specific batch.
Since there are billions of combinations, inevitably, some combinations will not exist. Unopened Packs may contain rare Illuvitars or Accessories
that allow them to generate as-of-yet unseen combinations.

**Free Tier 0 Illuvitar**

Previously, Tier 0 Illuvitars (technically free) cost about $20 to mint due to gas fees. With a layer two sale, we can instead add a free Tier 0 Illuvitar into each basic D1sk, making them accessible while keeping them somewhat rare.

**Illuvitar Album**

A collection game where collectors attempt to complete Collections, pages of Illuvitars all linked by a single attribute. There is a Collection for all the Water Illuvitars, a Collection for all the Rogue Illuvitars, and even one for all the Sunglasses. In all, there are over 500+ Collections. Each time you add an Illuvitar to a Collection, you gain points on the leaderboard. You earn additional points for completing a Collection. Players get prizes that differ in rarity depending on the difficulty of completion. The digital nature of these collections also allows us to let collectors use the SAME Illuvitar in multiple Collections, creating a mini-game where players look to bond the perfect attributes onto an Illuvitar so that collectors can use it on multiple pages. Maybe you need one more Water Illuvitar, plus one more Top Hat and Neon Rain background? Either buy a pack and cross your fingers or head to the IlluviDex, where someone might be willing to sell you a Top Hat and a Dash with Neon Rain background. Then you bond it and slam it into the album to complete 3 Collections with one Illuvitar.

## Rationale

We have a chance to make Illuvitars something truly unique as one of the first, and best, art sales on layer 2. We should take that opportunity and build something the community will truly love that will take on a life of its own and become one of the most popular apps in the ecosystem.
Moving the sale to IMX allows us the freedom to be even more creative. While some of these changes require a rework, the underlying tech of the NFTs themselves doesn’t change in any way, so there will not be much extra development time. We have already consulted with IMX on these changes, and they can assist us since they already use a similar flow for “Gods Unchained”. If this IIP passes, the team is ready to go with a fully developed plan on how to implement it quickly.
