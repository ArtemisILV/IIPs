## Simple Summary
To promote greater transparency and establish a sustainable structure for the Illuvinati Council's operations, the following proposal outlines three improvements.

1. The Council will be expected to meet regularly and report on its deliberations.

2. The Illuvium team will appoint a Community Manager to provide support and facilitate Council functions.

3. The Illuvium team will implement a Council section on the official website dedicated to reporting Council activities and other governance matters.


## Abstract
In the interests of transparency and sustainability, the Council will meet at least every two weeks and publish a report about the Council's deliberations, additional meetings may be required to address urgent action items. The information will provide the public with insight into each Council member's positions on proposals and the Council's consideration of other items of interest to the community. The Illuvium team will create a section on the official website dedicated to governance issues, including copies of the Council's reports, a governance calendar, and voting for Council members. The Illuvium team also will hire or appoint a Community Manager (who will report to the Council) to assist with the Council's operations and manage other governance issues. 

## Rationale
Given the rapid growth of the Illuvium community, the Council—the ultimate decision-maker for Illuvium's games and community—would benefit from changes that enhance visibility into the Council's deliberations and promote the structure and stability of Council operations.

These changes are motivated by prior Council activities, some of which were not readily visible to the community at large. For example, the Discord channel dedicated to Council debates (#council-chambers) has not consistently provided information about the Council's deliberations. Although Council members have actively engaged in discussions either directly with the community (such as on other Discord channels) or privately with Illuvium team members, the visibility of these conversations to the community has been limited because the Council dialogue had not been collected in a single, dedicated public location as a resource.

Accordingly, this proposal requires the Council to meet twice per month, at a minimum; the Council Members to write statements explaining their positions on proposals in advance of voting on proposals, and the Council to publish (with the assistance of a Community Manager) a report on the Council's deliberations. Additionally, to facilitate Council operations, the Illuvium team shall hire a Community Manager to manage all aspects of governance and provide a page on the official Illuvium website dedicated to governance and Council matters.

The benefits of these new requirements include the following (among others):

* Holding regular Council meetings, even in the absence of a pending proposal, will encourage the Council to discuss items of importance to the community and may spur the development of proposal submissions made by Council members.

* The publishing of regular reports, and the publishing of statements by Council Members in advance of voting, will increase the community's understanding of each Council member's positions on proposals and Illuvium's trajectory. Increased transparency will increase the community's trust in the Council's decisions.

* Making reports and other governance matters readily available in one website location will be helpful not just for the sake of posterity, but also for informing the community about each Council member's contributions, which will assist the community when voting for their leadership in Council elections.

* Reports on Council deliberations may clarify the intent of proposals, should any ambiguities arise, and close community debate.

* A dedicated Community Manager will streamline Council operations and minimize Council members' time spent on administrative duties, freeing them to focus on governance decisions and community discourse.

## Requirements

### Council Meetings

### Council members 

* Council meetings are held on Discord in <governance-voice>.

* Each Council member shall attend and participate in official meetings at least once every two weeks to discuss pending proposals and items of significant interest to the game or community.

* Each Council member also shall attend and participate in ad hoc official meetings as needed to take action on urgent proposals.

* Each proposal shall be discussed at an official meeting or an ad hoc meeting unless a majority of the Council determines that a public discussion is not necessary to vote on the proposal.

* In advance of voting on any proposal, and in advance of a meeting regarding such proposal (if such a meeting is held), each Council Member shall write a statement on Discord in #council-chambers describing his or her position on the proposal.

* At official meetings, each Council member shall make clear their position on each agenda item. Participation can be through voice or text. 

* If a Council member cannot attend an official meeting and the meeting cannot be rescheduled, such member must send to the Community Manager and the other Council members their views on each agenda item in advance.

* Attendance at official Council meetings ordinarily shall be restricted to Council members and the Community Manager. The Council may request that other specific individuals attend or open an official discussion to the general public if the Council believes that doing so would assist with the Council's deliberations.

* Council members may conduct unofficial meetings among themselves without the involvement of the Community Manager.

### Council Payment

* Each council member shall receive a $5000 USD equivalent payment per month in the form of $ILV tokens. 

A future ICCP may be written in the event that the community decides that the remuneration doesn’t match the workload of the Council. 

### Community Manager

The Illuvium team shall hire a Community Manager to manage all issues related to governance.

* The Community Manager shall monitor the community’s views on governance issues and inform the Council of such issues as needed.

* The Community Manager shall make a reasonable faith effort to schedule official meetings so that every Council member can attend. Official meetings shall be conducted within the Illuvium Discord channel <governance-voice>. 

* The Community Manager shall make a reasonable effort to prepare and circulate an agenda reasonably before each official meeting.

* After each official Council meeting, the Community Manager shall prepare a draft report.

* The report shall contain (i) a description of when and how the meeting was conducted; (ii) a roster of attendees; (iii) an agenda of items discussed at the meeting; (iv) a brief description of each Council member's position on each agenda item; and (v) a summary of the disposition of each agenda item (e.g., approved, disapproved, tabled for a later date).

* The Community Manager shall send the draft report to each Council member for their review and comment. The Community Manager will incorporate any comments received and send revised draft reports to each Council member. 

* The Community Manager shall publish the final report on the governance section of the website and any other channels they deem helpful to the community (e.g., on Discord). Unofficial meetings among Council members shall not require the drafting or publication of a report.

* The Community Manager shall be responsible for organizing and managing Council elections with the assistance of the Illuvium team.

A new IIP may be written in the future to expand on the Community Manager's duties as needed to facilitate the Council's effective governance of the community. 

### Tech Build 

* The Illuvium team shall build a section on the official Illuvium website dedicated to governance and include: (1) past and pending IIPs and ICCPs; (2) Council reports; (3) a calendar of future Council meetings, Council nominations and elections, and other governance-related deadlines and dates; (4) information on Council elections, including details on the nomination and voting processes; and (5) information on past and present Council members.

### Motion of No Confidence

* The repeated and unjustified failure by a Council Member to engage in reasonable faith with any of the requirements shall be grounds for another Council Member to raise a motion of no confidence.  Such failure may include but is not limited to failure to vote, the repeated and unjustified failure to attend and participate in Council meetings, or the repeated and unjustified failure to review and approve draft reports in a timely fashion.

* The Council shall make best efforts to notify the accused Council Member of the motion of no confidence and the grounds for the motion.

* Upon receipt of the motion of no confidence, the accused Council Member shall be given 72 hours to respond.  During that time, the accused may call a meeting with the Council Members and the Community Manager.

* After such a meeting, or if no such meeting has been held and 72 hours have passed, a majority vote of the other Council Members in favor of the motion of no confidence shall result in the immediate removal of the accused Council Member from the Council.
