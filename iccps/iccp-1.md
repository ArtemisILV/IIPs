## Simple Summary
Reduces council members payments from 30 ILV per epoch to a fixed value of $2500 USDT.

## Abstract
The intention is to lower per epoch payments to a more reasonable value after ILV's price rise.

## Rationale
Current 30 ILV payment is too high with ILV priced at $500-$600, so this ICCP is important to have it down to a value that sounds more reasonable and keeps stable regardless of future market moves.
